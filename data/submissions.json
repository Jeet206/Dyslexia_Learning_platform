    "content": "The Water Cycle\nThe water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Solar energy drives the cycle by heating water in the oceans, which evaporates into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere, where it cools and condenses around particles to form clouds. When the water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall to Earth as precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. The fallen water then flows over the ground as surface runoff, eventually returning to the oceans, or it seeps into the ground to become groundwater. Some groundwater is stored in aquifers, while some flows back to the surface through springs or is drawn up by plants and returned to the atmosphere through transpiration. The water cycle is essential for all life on Earth, as it distributes fresh water around the planet and helps regulate temperature and climate patterns.",

The fallen water then flows over the ground as surface runoff, eventually returning to the oceans, or it seeps into the ground to become groundwater.
